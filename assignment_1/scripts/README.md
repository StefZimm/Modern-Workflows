# **Modern Workflows**

1. PREP.R downloads the current data from: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data, 
merges datasets, cleans and harmonize the datasets, reshapes the and saves them. 

2. ANALYZE.rmd uses the generated datasets from PREP.R and creates graphics and a
project report in R-Markdown.
